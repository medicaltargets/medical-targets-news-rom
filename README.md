# Prezly Starter Theme

Prezly Starter Theme for your newsroom or blog based on Next.js 12+ framework:

- Made with [TypeScript], [Prezly SDK] and [Prezly Content React Renderer].
- Data-fetching is handled by [Prezly Theme Kit] and [Prezly SDK].
- Multi-language is powered by [React Intl] and [Prezly Themes Translations].
- Code-style is ensured by [ESLint] and [Prettier].
- Search is powered by [Algolia]

As we do not want to tell you how to style your project (CSS vs Sass vs CSS-in-JS vs styled components) and sure as hell do not want to force you on our preferred CSS framework **this theme does not have any styling loaded**. It is intended to be used as a boilerplate to start a new theme from.

The good news is that you don't have to start completely from scratch. Feel free to use the [Prezly theme UI Kit Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1083372101078898157) as a design guide.

## Documentation

### Routes

List of routes we automatically generate:

* **/** : Homepage listing stories
* **/[slug]** : Story page with slug provided by [Prezly SDK]

### Testing/Token

To make development and testing easier we have created a few sample newsrooms:

* **The Good Newsroom** [(preview on vercel)](https://theme-nextjs-starter-the-good-newsroom.vercel.app/): A newsroom filled with good news
* **Cookbook** [(preview on vercel)](https://theme-nextjs-starter-cookbook.vercel.app/): Recipes shared by the Prezly team
* **Anonymous Photographer** [(preview on vercel)](https://theme-nextjs-starter-photography.vercel.app/):  Pictures from a photographer. Combination of albums and imagery

A list of tokens/newsroom uuids that can be used to kickstart the theme.

| Name  | API Token  | Newsroom UUID |
|---|---|---|
| Good Newsroom  | `HKcab_nEbab_a7b2fe3a3465d3729772fa5381800ab5a0c30d8d`  | `578e78e9-9a5b-44ad-bda2-5214895ee036` |
| Cookbook  | `TKcab_nEbab_28432b75d3a85a826e51cd0b502a3d76acf98d19`  | `9d90b2c1-aed9-4415-a9fb-82dd3a2a1b52` |
| Anonymous Photographer | `SKcab_nEbab_0b63a6dd0b09286cc99fab93e6e80bfd9aecfbb5`  | `ce8299f6-a293-41df-8ffc-1c064d4401bc` |

### Accessing common data

The entire application is wrapped with `NewsroomContextProvider` and `IntlProvider` from [Next.js Theme Kit]
making it easy to access common objects like `newsroom`, `companyInformation`, `categories`, `languages`, `locale`
anywhere in the component tree.

For more information about these hooks please visit our [Next.js Theme Kit].

### Hooks

#### `useInfiniteLoading()`

Generic hook for continuous loading of any dataset keeping track of current page internally. An example implementation
for continuous loading of galleries can be found in the [`Galleries`](./tree/main/modules/Galleries/lib/useInfiniteGalleriesLoading.ts) module.

### Modules

#### `Layout`

This module takes care of rendering header and footer components as well as the subscribe form.
It also uses `PageSeo` component to render all the necessary meta tags with optional props to override
certain meta tag content like title (`og:title`), description (`og:description`) and image (`og:image`, `twitter:image`).

#### `PaginatedStories`

Classic query-parameter-based pagination, used in the starter theme by default in [`Stories`](./tree/main/modules/Stories) and [`Category`](./tree/main/modules/Category) modules.

#### `InfiniteStories`

Infinite loading of data with `Load More` button. Not used in the starter theme by default but an example usage can be found
in both [`Stories`](./tree/main/modules/Stories) and [`Category`](./tree/main/modules/Category) modules.
